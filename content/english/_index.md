A wise professor once burst my bubble and that of my classmates when he said “even a 4 year old can code, your grandma can learn to code... no, you are not coders, you are engineers. You must be able to comprehend a problem, design a solution, and solve that problem; it just so happens that you are using code to do so.“

Over the past 7 years, I have been honing this ability to rise above the code, see the forest for the trees and truly become a problem solver. “Problem solver” that is such a generic term, isn’t it? My experience rising from an intern to director of software engineering is anything but generic, and central to it is being able to solve problems, any problem, and I’d love to relate to you my journey.
